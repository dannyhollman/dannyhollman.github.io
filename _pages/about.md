title: About Me

I’m a Software Engineer. The projects that I’ve worked on recently are all built using the Unity game engine.  I am very familiar with the Unity editor, writing game scripts in C#, implementing virtual reality, and implementing augmented reality. Some of my recent projects include a single player VR experience, a multiplayer VR game, and an AR slingshot game.

My motivations for becoming a Software Engineer come from a life-long interest in technology and understanding how things work. In both my professional life as an online advertiser and in my personal life with hobbies like building Bitcoin miners, I have relied on many tools built by other people. I decided to join Holberton because I wanted to learn how to build these types of tools myself.

I am very motivated by the idea of helping to create something that can improve someone's life or bring them joy. This motivation is at the foundation of my decision to become a software engineer. The overwhelming majority of software is created with the intention of improving people’s lives in some way. In a team environment I think I could bring a unique perspective and clear communication that will help solve problems.
